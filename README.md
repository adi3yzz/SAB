### Shopee Autobuy Bot (Malaysia)

**For educational purpose only. Use at your own risk.**

Shopee Autobuy Bot is an automation program designed to assist users with purchasing products on the Shopee website, utilizing the [Selenium Framework](https://www.selenium.dev/) for the automation process. Initially a subscription-based program, I have now decided to make this project open source. The program will use an external API for configuration and program updates. Download the compiled program [here](https://github.com/pearlxcore/ShopeeAutobuyBot/releases). Suggestion or bug report [here](https://github.com/pearlxcore/ShopeeAutobuyBot/issues).


### Features
- Automates the purchasing process on the Shopee website.
- Uses the Selenium Framework for efficient and reliable automation.
- Allows users to set specific buying modes, such as "below specific price" mode.
- Schedule bot to run at a specific time, 5-10 seconds before the sale starts.
- Plays a sound notification on successful checkout.
- Enables auto-refreshing of the webpage.
- Allows users to disable website images and extensions.
- Supports various payment methods and can set a default payment on the browser.
- Allows users to specify the correct product link and quantity.
- Handles products with more than one variation, using the '|' character to separate each variation.
- Provides an option to enable coin/voucher redemption, although this may increase checkout time.

### Recommended setup:

* Bot settings
  - Play sound on successful checkout.
  - Disable website Image and Extension.
  - Enable auto-refresh webpage and set it to 0.

* Schedule Bot
  - Set the bot to run 5-10 seconds before the sale starts.

* Buying Mode
  - Use 'Below specific price' mode and set the price slightly higher than the sale's price.

* Payment Method
  - Use 'Default' to reduce checkout time, but make sure to set the default payment on the browser.

* Product Detail
  - Make sure to specify the correct product link and quantity.
  - If the product contains more than one variation, use the '|' character to separate each variation.

** **Enabling the coin/voucher redemption checkbox will increase checkout time. It's best not to enable it unless you really want to use it.**

** **Aim for less popular products for better chances.**
